1 Yes, you can configure your PERFECT WRITER to have 25 lines on a Kaypro '84.
2 And talk about easy! Just use any program like superzap, sodu, patch, etc.,
3 and open up the PW.SWP file. The SECOND BYTE OF CODE, "18" should be changed
4 to "19" ... viola! You now have 23 lines of text, with line 24 and 25 used
5 for the various messages PW generates.
6        Ain't it nice when something's easy?

8     Use this message to check whether your patch was successful... it has
9     23 lines, which should just fit in one screen of a 25 line PW program.

16   A final request: if you have any information on further enhancements
17   which can be made on the best of all CPM word processors (PW, of course)
18   please write me at the above address... I have created a "Wordstar-ized"
19   version of Perfect Writer which uses many WS commands for those of us
20   unwilling to learn a whole new command set. See PWLKWS23.ARK on this
21   system....

I hope someone with an Apple will reply to your message, but in case
no one does, here's what I know:

I don't think there are any "hidden incompatibilities" with either the
SOROC or the ADM definition.  The chances of there being any that were
not found by the "test terminal" routine in Config are quite small.

You can see what the sequences are by selecting the "edit definitions"
entry in the Config main menu.

The only possible source of an efficiency difference is if one
terminal provides built-in clear-to-end-of-line, which will be a
little faster than letting Mince do its own clearing by drawing
spaces.

Re: Disabling ctrl-A and ctrl-K on Videoterm 80 col. board
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI

  Now that I have a keyboard enhancer to add to my Apple cpm system
I find it a great inconvenience that the Videx videoterm 80 col.
board swallows ctrl-A and ctrl-K characters (especially since these
are 2 of my favorite commands in Mince).
  I called Videx and their only suggestion was to modify my
Videoterm Firmware (supposedly they are sending me the description
of how to do that). This seems like the cleanest solution, but it
is non-trivial for me to implement since I don't know the first
thing about writing proms, but it might be fun to learn. Does anyone
have a device for writing 2708 eproms that I might obtain access to
(I'm in central Mass. but make trips into Boston periodically)?
Is this the kind of thing you can get a dealer to do for you?
  What alternatives are there for solving the ctrl-A/ctrl-K problem?
In CPM is there some way to separate input and output functions so
that output goes to the 80 column board but input bypasses it (going
directly from Keyboard enhancer to CPM)?? 
  Any suggestions or comments greatly appreciated,
      Glenn

        Where is archived information on mince & scribble modifications
to be found?  I'm in search of experience with adding basic macro capabilities
A letter to the Texas users' group address has brought no reply.

	It seems to me that Tabs are NOT conserved in a @VERBATIM[]
environment. someone else want to check that out?

	how about a title page environment? Or a @Citation environment
that has a separate counter from Note, and puts its contents into the
bibliography?

1. explain more verbosely

2. Sorry. I will try to be more brief.

3. Too late to do anything about this month's. I could send a
   ready-for-scribble-or-scribe file out every month,
   or just take all the indent out, as you wish. Geez, We're just
   beginning, so i can't be expected to be perfect (yet).

1. Using a Local Modes list at the end of a file is the "right" way to
do local modes in emacs.  -*- Teco-*- is historical.

2. The newsletter is too verbose.

3. Can you cut the indentation out of the on-line copy?

          Amethyst Users Group                              Newsletter No.1





                                Amethyst Users Group

                                The First Newsletter



            This is the first newsletter  for  the  Amethyst Users Group. I
          had not expected to have anything to say so soon, but as it turns
          out  there  are  a  lot  of  things that  everyone  seems  to  be
          interested in.

            In addition to this users group, there is a mailing list on the
MIT-AI,   which  I  administrate
          (ARPANET is the  Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork, a DOD
          run  computer  network  linking  some  150  university,  DOD, and
          industry  machines). I urge all of  you  who  are  users  of  the
          ARPANET to have me put  you  on  this mailing list. There will be
          abstracts of the discussions that the AMETHYST-USERS  generate in
          each monthly newsletter, but the  discussion-like  forum  of  the
          mailing list will make it a real  plus  if  you  have  access. If
          enough  folk  request  it, I will include complete transcripts of
          AMETHYST-USERS mail in  this  newsletter  each  month, instead of
          abstracting it (fine with me, since it saves me work). The reason
          that  I am initially abstracting it is that I suspect it will run
          to  great  length,  and it will get very bulky (and expensive  to
          mail). This mailing list is free (not that I would charge, but it
          has  to  be, since any profit generating activities are  strictly
          forbidden  on  the  ARPANET,  and although the users group is non
          profit, I have already had my knuckles rapped for  trying to drum
          up support for the users group).

            As I worked on this, our first newsletter, I saw that there are
          going to be a lot of very  verbose  (of  necessity)  comments and
          suggestions that I  am  going  to  receive  here.  I guess I will
          publish in full, or at least as much as I can, any relevant info,
          tips, or ideas that are sent me. If you are an ARPANET user, mail
AI  as  I can read it with my
          machine, and save time and errors.

            I would like to  request  that  all correspondence intended for
          Amethyst Users Group be sent to:

          Austin Texas 78741

          Hate mail sent to the P.O. Box  will  be  included  in subsequent
          issues  of  the  newsletter  (subject  to  edit,  naturally).  My
          telephone number is  (512)441-9466,  and  feel  free  to  call me
          anytime, i am usually up until all hours of the night.

            Something that will  no  doubt  take  up  a lot of space in the
          first few issues  of this news letter will be simple suggestions.
          I am not the wizard at C  hackery  that some Amethyst owners are,
          so this issue is full of ideas I have had kicking about, and have
          not had the time to begin to implement. I throw them out as germs
          of  ideas  that someone else may also like, perhaps enough to  do
          the work, or work with me to realize some  of  these things. Your
          suggestions for extensions are also welcome as  much  work can be
          avoided  by properly defining the task at hand, and  this  letter
          can  be  a  forum for  defining  and  determining  the  shape  of
          extensions yet unborn.

            I   offer  without  apology  some  suggestions  here  that  are
          blatantly  EMACS-like,  even to the point of lifting descriptions
          from the EMACS manual. This may seem snobbish to non-EMACS users,
          but  it is just that I have experience with EMACS. It is probably
          true that EMACS and PL/1 share the fact that  both  are too large
          for any one user to ever  expect  to  use all the features of the
          language.  I am pointing out those features of EMACS that I  tend
          to use that are not included in the standard  MINCE. Feel free to
          tell me that  you don't need them or that you think my MINCE will
          grow to over a megabyte.



                                        Modes



            One  of the things that is of interest is  how  automatic  mode
          switching in MINCE  is  to  be  implemented.  I have seen several
          basic ways, and each have their good points and their bad points.



            1.  The first is one that many people support as 'natural' to a
                CP/M environment. This is to  have  MINCE  set the mode for
                the buffer based on  the extent of the file in that buffer.
                This  technique  is  one  that   requires   no   additional
                information to be included in  the  text  file  itself.  In
                other  words, a file with the extent  .PL1  would  set  the



                                        - 2 -






          Amethyst Users Group                              Newsletter No.1



                (nonexistent) PL1 mode, and a file with the extent .C would
                set  the  (nonexistent)  C  mode.  This  is  a  very  clean
                implementation, and one that poses few problems,  at  least
                when one is only dealing with source code  of  one  sort or
                another.

            2.  If your  extent names are not of a nature to provide useful
                information to MINCE,  fear  not.  I often use extents that
                are just numbers, increasing as those inevitable  revisions
                occur. I want my MINCE to automatically increment my extent
                numbers on C-X C-S operations. Unfortunately, the extent is
                not going to  provide  useful  information  for SetModes in
                this  case. A solution to the problem is to include  on  te
                first line of  a  file a command of the form -*-MODENAME-*-
                or  something like that. This will horrify some of  you  no
                doubt. It can  be  included  in  your  source  files  as  a
                comment, and is  a relatively benign way to do things. This
                is one of  the ways that EMACS does it, and i suggest it as
                something  to  mull over. Lots  of  poeple  are  vehemently
                opposed to this because they see it as 'messy'.

            3.   Another  option is to have an 'init' file  someplace.  For
                example, my 'system' diskette, in the A drive might contain
                MINCE, a compiler,  a  linker,  and whatever else I use all
                the time. My work disk in the  B drive might contain copies
                of whatever it is I am doing, and  file  that  has  default
                settings  in  it. A TEXT.INI file might contain information
                concerning the mode I normally like  to edit text in, how I
                usually set my tabs, where the indent and fill columns are,
                and  of course room for expansion. Mince would look  for  a
                'filename.INI' on the  logged  drive first (so I would have
                to  enter  MINCE  from  B:),  and  load  these  parameters,
                superceding any values  set in the .SWP file. Maybe this is
                too  much  of  a kludge too, and the more I think about it,
                the  worse  it gets. It may also be possible to put default
                modes in the .SWP files, but .SWP  files  are  awfully big,
                and I don't relish  having a lot of them around, whereas an
                .INI file only need be a few  pages long, if that. This has
                fundamental problems with hard disk that is  not  split  up
                into numerous logical  drives,  since MINCE would just pick
                up on the first .INI file it found. It would work well with
                MARC or  any **NIX, where your working directory would have
                the  .INI  file  and  just  a  link  to  MINCE  in  another
                directory.

            4.  Personally I support a  system  that first checks to see if
                the extent corresponds to a valid mode,  or if it does not,
                looks in the  first  line for a modename, or failing all of
                the above sets the default  mode (from the .SWP file, which
                means that CONFIG now has to set this sort of thing up, 65K
                CONFIG here we come....).

          Amethyst Users Group                              Newsletter No.1



            There  is another fundamental problem in just what one  expects
          out  of a Mode. I think everyone expects for a mode  to  redefine
          basic syntactic movement units (paragraph,  sentence and word) to
          be more useful  (e.g.  function,  statement,  atom)  in  the  new
          context.  Many  folks   expect  balancing  of  certain  syntactic
          delimiters (parentheses in LISP, or curly braces in C).  Matching
          of Scribble delimiters  in  .MSS  mode would be nice. Some expect
          indentation to be automatic, others are content to merely  have a
          pretty  printer bound to M-G (Grind Text, I find it more mnemonic
          than M-Q), most want both. Should there  be  a rudimentary parser
          in the mode to check  for  correct  syntax  (and  help  put those
          semicolons in the  right  place in ALGOL)? Remember that the more
          we add the bigger this thing gets, and the farther out of hand it
          goes. As soon as Mark of the  Unicorn  adds  overlays,  we can do
          some nf these more exotic things.



                                       Macros



            Another  thing  folks  seem to be interested in is macros. Some
          have suggested that  macros  be  only  a  single  line  long (and
          displayed  in the echo line), and others have  suggested  editing
          macros in  a  buffer,  and then executing them out of the buffer,
          (shades of  Minibuffers full of TECO code). I would be happy with
          an 80 character macro buffer (better yet  three or four different
          macro buffers) to which I could give  a repeat count, as i'm hard
          pressed to think of many sequences that will require more than 80
          characters. The advantage I see in having them in regular buffers
          is that they can be saved like  any  old  file. I haven't thought
          much about macros or  macro  buffers,  so  i'm ready to hear some
          input from you about the topic.

            There is a problem in that I can't think of a good place to put
          macros.  I  don't  want them in my terminal support but since the
          low level character I/O gets called from everywhere I can't think
          of many other  really  good places. Once again, I haven't thought
          on this one much longer than it took to write this.



                                Command Line Options



            Another good  suggestion  is  loading  more  than one file into
          separate buffers from the original command line. It doesn't sound
          too  hard to me, except that I could easily  see  the  .SWP  file
          overflow if you use this  one  much with those files that seem to
          grow to excess.

                              Marks and Kills on a Ring



            I would like to see more than  one  mark  available. Perhaps we
          could have a ring buffer (circular array) of marks, and a command
          that rotated the ring. Kill rings would be even nicer, of course.
          Inspiration  for  this comes from tinkering  with  EMACS,  but  I
          haven't the slightest idea how to begin implementation.



                        M-' Fix up omitted shift key on digit



            Quoted from the EMACS Manual for TWENEX Users:

                 Another common error  is  to type a special character
               and miss the  shift  key,  producing  a  digit instead.
               There is a special  command  for  fixing  this: M-' (^R
               Upcase Digit), which  fixes the last digit before point
               in  this  way  (but only if that digit appears  on  the
               current  line  or  the  previous  line.  Otherwise,  to
               minimize random  effects  of  accidental  use, M-' does
               nothing). Once again, the cursor does not  move, so you
               can use M-' when you notice  the  error and immediately
               continue   typing.   Because  M-'  needs  to  know  the
               arrangement of your keyboard, the first time you use it
               you  must  supply the information by typing the row  of
               digits 1,2,...,9,0 but holding down the shift key. This
               tells M-' the correspondence between digits and special
               characters, which is remembered for the duration of the
               EMACS. This command is called  M-' because its main use
               is to replace "7" with a single-quote.

          The  correspondence between digits and characters could be stored
          in  a .SWP file or a .INI file (above). Of course,  it  could  be
          implemented just as  described  here with the initialization code
          existing as an overlay to save space.



                                   Bugs and Quirks



            Here are some  bugs/quirks  I  have noted in Scribble/Crayon in
          preparing this letter.

            1.  The  -p  option  in Crayon causes the pause to occur before
                the newline at the end of the page. This causes problems if
                your printer waits  to  print  a line until it recieves the
                newline at the end of the  line,  as  mine  does, since you
                will not get a page number at the bottom of the  page,  but
                at the top of the next one instead.

PageHeading  directive  can  only  appear  once,  or
                Scribble tells you that you lose, I didn't see  any note in
                the manual about this.

                  CDOS Compatibility



            I  have  done work getting MINCE, SCRIBBLE, and MARC  (more  on
          MARC later...) up on various  versions of CROMEMCO CDOS (TM). The
          verdict is that MINCE and SCRIBBLE choke (do not run at  all)  on
          all  versions  of  CDOS  before  2.12,  which includes but is not
          limited  to  0.17,  0.20 and 1.07 CDOSii. MINCE and SCRIBBLE (and
          compiling and linking with BDS C 1.43 and the L2 linker)  seem to
          be fully functional in CDOS 2.12 and 2.17. It seems that there is
          an  incompatibility  in  early CDOS versions in that two  of  the
          locations in the  BIOS jump table (or two of the BDOS commands, I
          forget which) are reversed. I have forgotten just how much slower
          CDOS is than CP/M. I am  getting  the CP/MUG #49 which has a CP/M
          2.2 BIOS for the 4FDC on  it,  and  I will report on how AMETHYST
          fares  in this environment. MINCE should be incredible on  PerSci
          drives.

            If you seem to  have  incredible  problems  getting anything to
          work under your  CDOS,  and there is no local CDOS wizard who can
          wave his magic software patch wand, I recommend the following man
          whom I have  never  met  personally  but  who  has  commanded the
          respect of a lot of my friends  and  whose  coding  can  only  be
          described as incredible.  He  specializes in CDOS systems, and so
          can probably help you out.

          Mr. Gunn doesn't have a AMETHYST yet, but I'm going to go to work
          on him as soon as  I  can.  In any event his knowledge of CDOS is
          probably indespensible.

            MARC  is  an  operating  system  soon  to  be marketed  by  BDS
          Software, which appears to the user to  be a single task UNIX (in
          other words, many users, but  only  one  at  a  time). There were
          plans at one time to include MINCE as the system editor for MARC.
          As I understand it, MARC will come with BDS  C, and assembler, an
          editor  that  looks  a  lot like the UNIX ED, MINCE, a handful of
          utilities, and (possibly) a CP/M <-->  MARC transfer utility, and
          a CP/M emulator for  MARC.  I have gotten MARC (Boot Version B.7,
          Root Version B.1) up on CDOS 2.12 and 2.17, but in order for MARC
          not to choke to death, the -R option MUST be specified.  It seems

                                  Comparison Chart



            One of the members of the  mailing list is interested in seeing
          a  MINCE  to  EMACS difference/comparison  chart.  If  anyone  is
          interested  it  seems  to  me that the task could be done up very
          nicely,  and  easily.  Since  most EMACS installations  have  the
          manual online someplace, and near the end is a wall chart that is
          very similar to  the  MINCE  short  command  list,  and  we  have
          SCOMM.DOC online, so  that  one  only needs to hack the two files
          into  one.  A  double column command comparison (or  better  yet,
          three column: ITS EMACS, TWENEX EMACS, MINCE) should  only  waste
          about  half  a  day  of someone's time. It probably wouldn't take
          much work other than a lot of cut and paste in the editor.



                                The First Submission



            Of  course,  I have submitted it:  it's  called  MLIST.C.  It's
          basically a very simple mailing label printer, the one I am using
          to keep track  of  the  AUG  membership.  There are no fields, no
          record sizes, only  record  marks in the data file. Mince is used
          for  updating  (since  it  has  all the features I need in such a
          program). Most mailing list systems  I have seen either limit you
          in the information you can include, or  waste lots of empty space
          with  half full records of fixed length. Besides, all the ones  I
          have seen seem to cost  more  than  I  think  they  are  worth. I
          include  MLIST in the AUG library since it depends  on  MINCE  to
          make it go.

            The  file  format  is  as follows: anything  up  to  the  first
          delimiter DEL1 is  ignored. I include information on how the file
          is formatted, and what the file is full of before the  first DEL1
          delimiter. Everything between DEL1 and DEL2 is printed (CP/M list

                                    Miscellaneous



            I am charging $6.00  annually  for  membership  in the Amethyst
          Users  Group  in  North  America   (USA,   Canada,   Mexico   and
          California). I will charge  $14 for annual membership for members
          in distant lands. Membership privileges include getting your name
          and  suggestions  in  print,  having this newsletter delivered to
          your doorstep by your friendly mailman, and  access  to the users
          group  library.  Initially,  disks,  should   they   ever  become
          available, will be $6.00 each. I have no idea how much Disks will
          cost to ship to  anyplace outside of the USA, so you will have to
          wait until I go to the post office with a packed diskette box and
          weigh it. If it turns out that I lose money on the users group (I
          can't afford  to  pay  out of my pocket) I will raise the cost of
          diskettes, and not the cost of the  membership.  I  will ship you
          diskettes in diskette mailers that  should  protect them from the
          worst ravages of the USPS. These  mailers  cost me a little more,
          but are well worth the price,  since  disks  arrive in one piece,
          and unfolded. I will not  be  able  to  personally reply to every
          inquiry that will be made, although I will include it in the next
          newsletter.  If  you  expect  an  immediate  response,  enclose a
          self-addressed stamped envelope, it may  not  seem  like  much to
          you, but if I have to buy twice as many stamps and envelopes each
          month, this poor boy will be in the lurch.

            If you wrote to me  asking  to  join and forgot to enclose your
          membership fee (or plain didn't know that there was one, which is
          probably my fault), you get one (and only one)  free  copy of the
          next newsletter, to pique  your  interest,  and  oil  your wallet
          bone.  In  other  words, if you haven't paid your membership fee,
          this is your free copy. This newsletter will  be  mailed over the
          ARPANET to AMETHYST-USERS also.

            Please specify the  format that you want (or if you're sending,
          write  the  the  format on the label). I can distribute in Single
          Side Single Density  IBM  8"  format, Tarbell 8" 51 Sector Double
          Density, Ohio Scientific CP/M 8", and Cromemco CDOS 5 1/4" Single
          Density, and eventually, in N* single  density  (I  just recently
          got a N* controller board without docs or software, and am trying
          to scrounge up enough info to get it to fly). Please, if you send
          me  a  IBM  8" diskette,  do  not  send  me  one  that  you  have
          reformatted with your single  density  controller,  since I use a
          controller that has  a  1791  on  it  and  it cannot read the gap
          information that the 1771 writes  onto  the disk when formatting.
          If I am to read it it must either be on  a  disk  that  is  still
          using the factory format, or if you have a Tarbell Single Density
          controller,  I  can  give  you  a  format program that you should

          replace your current one with, that will format  disks so that we

          diskette and shipping, (i.e. provide your own diskettes for me to
          copy to and save). I should be able to distribute in RT-11 format
          also, that is, I have an RT to CPM transfer utility that seems to
          function properly,  but  I  don't have an 11 to run the resultant
          copies on, so caveat emptor for RT. Also the RT to  CP/M  utility
          asks some questions  (about how the directory should be arranged)
          that i'm not quite sure i can answer correctly, never having used
          an RT.

            Please  pack any disks you send me properly  (i.e.  in  one  of
          those nice boxes from INMAC that I will be using). This point was
          brought  home  some  days  ago  when  some  disks  that  had been
          improperly packed (but were sent  special  delivery)  were FOLDED
          into my mailbox (special huh?). Any disk you send  me with useful
          things on it, I will you one for,  hopefully  with something neat
          on it (your choice, once there is something to choose from).

            Proofreading this, I  see  that  I  have tended to use a lot of
          'computerese' and have favored terse technical terms  to  verbose
          plain-text  circumlocutions.  I sincerely apologize to those  who
          are lost. The directions for getting there (as they were given to
          me...) go like this:

                 Go to San Diego and take a left, and keep going until
               the water is  up  around  your hubcaps. Get out of your
               car and get a suntan. Play Frisbee. Use the nearest pay
               phone to call AAA and  your lawyer, who will send you a
               travel guide and tell you how your  divorce proceedings
               are going, respectively. Enjoy.



                                    Happy Coding!

To: SK at MIT-AI, Tappan at BBNG

One reason that we gave ^X ^S its current behavior is just what SK
mentions: if your disk is very small, you can't afford to keep free
space sufficient to hold your largest file.  Another is that we expected
by now to have incremental state save working, that would make it possible
to use the information in the swap file to recover from hardware errors.
Unfortunately, we ran out of memory before we got there.  Sigh.

In-Reply-To: Your message of 21-May-81 0018-EDT

Why would someone use ^X^W? Actually thats my major gripe about MINCE,
^X^S does an immediate overwrite of the old file. I lost a fairly large
file once through a freak disk accident (MINCE started writing the file,
clobbering the old one, then a disk error occured on the swapping disk,
making CPM decide it was read-only, which crashed MINCE and lost all
copies of the file) Using ^X^W would have prevented that (as would
a slightly more intelligent ^X^S). As soon as I have time I'm going to
fix ^X^S to write to a temp file and then rename.

We consider it a feature that Mince recovers well from a full swap file.
What else should it do?

There are several opinions as to what should be in the other window after
a ^X 2; the only one we really like would take too much space to
implement.

Why can't you use your Meta key?  We use ours...  Just like you said,
change the I/O to do direct port access with 8 bit characters.  It
works fine (if your hardware cooperates).

Why does anyone use ^X ^W?  I mean, sure, I use it a couple of times
a week, but ^X ^S is much more convenient for the usual case...  (And
safer if the ^X gets lost!)

I have code to make meta-<digits> work.  I will send it to Barry.  It's
not very big, but takes just enough space that the redundant functionality
was considered wasteful for the standard version.

Other people have complained about ^W/^Y to move text.  We don't have
q-regs, but a command to move or copy the region to or from a specified
buffer in one operation would be easy enough.  Somebody write it!

Yeah, we know, framing (choosing exactly what text shall appear on the
screen) is one of Mince's weak points.  I have code, which I will also
send to Barry, to scroll the screen up or down by a specified number
of lines without moving the point.  This helps somewhat.

The @BlankSpace bug has been fixed.

Is ^S insufficient for controlling the -c output?  It seemed fine to me,
especially since Scribble pauses for a moment to set up between pages.

Scribble itself doesn't know about XON/XOFF for the printer; in fact,
it doesn't pay attention to the direct I/O either, it just does bios(5,c)
to get characters out.  Crayon, however, should do the right thing for you.
The latest Scribble (1.1) is much happier in 56K; 1.0 is truly a memory
hog.  Cutting Scribble's memory requirements is currently a top-priority
project.

I think Craig is working on something to let you turn off higher levels
of sectioning, so you can just have plain numbered paragraphs.

There are a couple of bug fixes in the C compiler since 1.42.  Other
versions around 1.43 have different bugs; there is in fact only one
version of the compiler that will successfully compile Scribble, and
Lifeboat never shipped it.  But it had another bug...

Keep those cards and letters coming, folks!

I use C-X C-W to write into a file which has another name in Emacs,
I assume it works the same way in Mince.  What do you mean by
"safer"?

From: Frank J. Wancho <FJW at MIT-MC>
Subject:  Random Bugs (nits) and Feature Requests
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI
cc: FJW at MIT-MC

I have asked Scott if he wanted these "privately" or to the list.
Although he hasn't seen these items, he said to the list.  So here it
is.  Bear in mind that I really do like Mince for the reasons I gave
in a previous msg, but I find some things annoying...  As for
Scribble, I will acknowledge that it is a preliminary release.

<NIT MODE ON>

On Mince 2.5:

With a 64K SWP file, trying to read in a second file (both about 37K)
in the other window gives a "Swap file full" message, if you're
watching at the time and lucky enough to catch it, and then proceeds
as if nothing happened - that is, until you try to read past a certain
point in the second file and see the wraparound.

The second window ought to be empty when you first invoke it with ^X2.

Since I have a terminal with a META key, why can I not define it and
change the I/O to do direct port access and preserve the parity bit
for this purpose?

Random msgs, like "Unknown command" ought to return the cursor to
where it was.  Deliberate displays, like from ^X^B ought to gobble up
the next character and return the display to normal rather than taking
whatever the next character is as input.  ^G works, though...

If a swap happens to occur just as you typed ^X^W and it comes back to
see just the ^W...  also, if you type just a CR to the ^X^W prompt,
the current filename is very briefly displayed with no chance to
confirm!

The "Swapping" msg writes over a previous "Unknown command" msg and
leave part of it there.

I miss being able to type <ESC>n or <ESC>nn, etc., instead of the
rather painful ^Un or ^Unn as a multiplier.

I dearly miss ^Xx<qreg> and ^Xg<qreg> as a neat way to move text
around as an alternate to ^W/^Y.

If you choose the cursor position for redisplay as 0 (or any number, I
guess), it *ALWAYS* puts the cursor at that line, even for M-> (an
empty screen for 0) and ^S/^R.  (Will there ever be an Incremental
Search???)  I would much prefer being able to specify, say, line 8 for
^L, and have the equivalent of 90fs%end for things like adding text to
the end or M->, and also have <ESC>0^L for scooting the current line
up to the top of the screen...  With a line 0 for any redisplay,
things are really strange with repetitive ^S's when you are on the
bottom of the screen and it scoots up one line for the next occurance
instead of presenting a new screenful...


On Scribble 1.0:

You can't seem to type:

@BlankSpace(2 lines)

wherever you want - just once it seems.

When you use the -c feature for previewing, it ought to optionally
wait for any character input before proceeding to the next screenful.
(Maybe -c for continuous with short pause, and -t for wait???)

I set up a Direct Pin and Direct Pout and set for Diablo10 and changed
the sync for XON/XOFF and SCRIBBLE ignored it for a XEROX 1750 (Diablo
1650) and overran the printer's buffer.  (I know it works ok with WS
at 1200 baud... because that's what I had to revert to...).  I never
got to CRAYON because I tried to generate the FIN file and ran out of
memory in a 56K machine with a 5K document!!!  (I was able to generate
a FIN file on a 58K machine earlier for Spin10...)

How can I tell SCRIBBLE that I just want plain numbered paragraphs?
(Not @Enumerate, since I may want unnumbered paragraphs in between.
"0.0.0.1" from just having @Paragraph w/o any higher level numbering
isn't exactly what I had in mind...)


On documentation:

If you buy AMETHYST, should you also get instructions on how to use
BDS-C to create whatever - a sample session would greatly help there.

How different is this BDS-C from 1.42 which we also recently got as an
update from Lifeboat separately?

Subject: Z-80 optimizations
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI

Leor's compiler currently does no Z-80 optimizations; the only thing
that can happen differently on a Z-80 is that the 'movmem' library
routine uses the Z-80 block move instruction.  And if you look
closely at the problem, it turns out that the compiler really has
little to gain by using the special Z-80 instructions -- the index
registers are nearly useless, though admittedly, relative jumps would
save a few bytes here and there.

Even if the compiler was intelligent about Z-80s, recompilling the command
set would do little good.  The place where optimizations would
really make a difference is in the buffer management and redisplay
code (i.e., the parts for which we don't supply the source), as
these account for about 2/3 of the final code size and are written
in such a way that any optimizations in register usage (for example)
will make a considerable difference.  The command-set code is mostly
subroutine calls, while the buffer and redisplay code is heavy on
repetitive pointer-to-structure references and the like.

So don't ask about Z-80 optimization -- Leor has no plans to do it
anyway.  Sometime in the next few months we may hand-compile the
buffer and redisplay code into assembler, and THAT will make a
difference.  Besides, there are plenty of very useful optimizations
Leor could do that would also make a difference in 8080 code; these,
I think, would be more worthwhile.

Subject:  Z80 Only Version?
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI
cc: FJW at MIT-MC

I am really quite impressed with MINCE, especially in that it uses the
LRU algorithm - it appears that I can directly access any part of the
file without paging the file through memory (unlike WS, WM, and
others).

What I'd like to know is if I can recompile the command set as is and
use the Z80 option to gain some optimization for my particular
environment?  As far as that goes, has it been determined whether or
not an entire MINCE (and SCRIBBLE) completely compiled with that
option is any smaller or runs any faster than the regular version?  In
particular, I am interested in the relative speeds of the searches in
both cases.  (I sure do miss the Incremental Search commands...and the
q-regs... - has anyone generated a list of the differences between
MINCE and EMACS??)

Subject: archiving, and a query
To: AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI

	we are now archived in mc:jcaf;aug arch
special thanks to plk@mc for generously providing us space.

	someone wanted to know a bit more about amethyst...
for those of you who are not actual owners of the package here
it goes:
	amethyst is an ersatz emacs and an ersatz scribe for the
8080 and z80. both are extensible, and are written in bds c.
the source for thecommand set is provided with amethyst, so that
users can hack up extensions to fulfill their every desire. it is
hoped that this mailing list, and the actual user's group (which
is a discrete entity) will create a forum and community in which
valuable extensions andddevelopments will be shared by all, and
no one will spend time reinventing the wheel, (provided someone
invents it in the forst place).
	both mince and scribble (the components of amethyst) can
run and compile in a 48k cp/m. a cpm compatible operating system is
nominally required for operation. cdos, sdos, imdos, tpm, oasis, and
marc all should fit the bill. also one needs a cursor addressable terminal
but i suspect that one could accomplish some magic in the terminal
support routines that would do very nicely for a memory mapped
video board.
mark of the unicorn, the authors, are ambitiously working on getting
amethyst  onto other machines that support c. i am given to
understand that the entire package is very portable, and running
under one of the new **nix breed of operating systems  is not a
difficult task.
	bds c can run on a modified cpm (org=4300) but i do not
know if work has been done to get amethyst onto such a system.
	my personal reccomendation is to have a 64k system, with
double density drives (persci's  since they're so fast) or a hard
disk, and marc or a similar 'new age' os.



	the amethyst users group is a non-profit organization,
dedicated to the furtherance of the amethyst system. aug is not
directly connected with, or sponsored by mark of the unicorn, the
authors of amethyst.mark of the unicorn, however, does retain
a membership in the amethyst users group, so that no one is groping
in the dark, so to speak. any fees, dues, or charges levied by the
amethyst users group for membership, publications, or programs & associated
media reflect the actual cost incurred in the production therof, and
do not result in the generation of profits. the amethyst users group
is not connected with this mailing list, except in that there may be
an overlap in membership & membership in one does not imply membership
in the other, however it may appear.

							     4 May 1981

     Dear Amethyst Owner;

	   You have by now heard of the Amethyst Users Group, of which I am
     head. It is the nature of things that everyone eventually gets what he
     wants, and for my sins I was rewarded with charge of the users group.
     Your ideas are by all means welcome, as this is just
     as much your users group. EMACS has benifitted greatly from a healthy
     interaction of its users, and it is hoped that MINCE will be able to
     follow this tradition.
	   I will put out a written newsletter. I suppose that I will have
     to have something to say first, or else you will be subjected to my
     incessant ramblings (unpleasant at best). The solution is for you to
     contribute things to the cause. If you are working on some project in
     particular, like a C mode, I can publish a note in the news letter
     about it (as verbose as you wish). Between news letters, if more than
     one person or group appears to be working on the same thing, I will
     try to put them in touch with each other, to speed the process.
	   I cannot eat the cost of publishing and mailing newsletters and
     disks, so I will be forced to charge a bit for membership, primarily
     to subsidize mailing you newsletters & such. For the nonce, I will
     charge $6.00 for membership (an annual fee). Disks, when and as they
     become available, will also run $6.00 each. These are North American
     prices, Botswana costs more. If i start to lose money, i will raise
     the cost of diskettes, but i don't expect to start losing any soon.
     There is an ARPANET mailing list, which is is free, and is called
     AMETHYST-USERS at AI. You can send net mail to me, BADOB at AI, and i
     will put you on. If you have access to the net, i urge you to get on
     this mailing list, as there will no doubt be much more action here
     that i can account for in the monthly letter.
	   I can distribute in Single Side Single Density IBM 8" format,
     Tarbell 8" 51 Sector Double Density, Ohio Scientific CP/M 8", and
     pending the return of my 4FDC from the factory (next week, I'm told) I
     should be able to distribute in Cromemco CDOS 5 1/4" Single Density .
     I will also offer a transfer service from one of the above formats to
     another at about $2.00 per disk, plus diskette and shipping, (i.e.
     provide your own diskettes for me to copy to and save). I should be
     able to distribute in RT-11 format also, that is, I have an RT to CPM
     transfer utility that seems to function properly, but I don't have an
     11 to run the resultant copies on, so caveat emptor for RT.
	   Please pack any disks you send me properly (i.e. in one of those
     nice boxes from INMAC). This point was brought home a few weeks ago
     when some disks that had been improperly packed (but were sent special
     delivery) were FOLDED into my mailbox (special huh?). I should have a
     post office box now, which may or may not help matters. Any disk you
     send me I will send back, hopefully with something neat on it (your
     choice, once there is something to choose from).
           As of right now, there is nothing in the library, and while a
     few people are interested in geting something, i haven't heard of any
     projects to write anything. Also, there is no archive (per se) for the
     AMETHYST-USERS, so if you have an account on an ITS amchine, and have
     some space to spare, perhaps you could let us archive there.

	There is now a users group for Amethyst users. Plans include
a monthly newsletter, and distribution of submitted user extentions.
Amethyst (for those who don't recall) is a EMACS-ish  extensible
text editor and a SCRIBE-ish extensible formatter all in C.

	Amethyst Users Group

	Also it exists as a mailing list, AMETHYST-USERS@AI. if you are
interested in either mail to me, or snail to the above address.

Subject: mince crash
To: amethyst-users at MIT-AI

My second day using mince, I gave a demo to my boss.  About 75%
through the demo, mince (or my H89) crashed (it stopped listening to
the keyboard so I rebooted).

On restarting Mince, I discovered it was hung (cursor stopped to the
right of the modeline; keys had no effect).  I did a filecopy of a
backup swap file to my disk and the world was safe for humans.

Has anyone else encountered a similar problem?

(Oh, I haven't read any of the documentation yet, so it might be in there).

I have problems with my (perkin elmer fox 1100) hanging from time to time,
and so i have to twiddle the switches under the access plate to reset the
machine, but mince hasn't really died on me but for one time...

I had told it C-X C-S, and the lights on my front panel said that things
were progressing ok, and then it hung. Before the 'File Written' prompt.
I could tell by the lights that it wasn't in cp/m at all, it was down
below 0x0fff someplace. (i diddled with the switches under the access plate,
force of habit, but nothing...) Reset. look at the disk, and the file,
which should have been around 25K or so is 1K long. use disk.c to reconstruct
the file from the fragmented remains. I was assured that my problem was a
random accident related to the tides & other similar phenomena. I am
inclined to agree with that prognosis, as my system often hangs when i run my
'slightly crufty' memory boards instead of my 'not as crufty' board.

still, i would be curious to know what it was thet you were doing when the
loss occured.

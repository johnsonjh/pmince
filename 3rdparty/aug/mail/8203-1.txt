We have a Videx 80-col card and a KBD-enhancer card for our Apple II.
It seems that the 80-col card is eating ^A and ^K and using them for
its own purposes.  Can anybody help?  Maybe we could fix it by making
the input routine not go through the videx card.  Anybody know how
this is normally fixed?

Thanks,
Leigh.

Now that I got my Softcard working properly I set out to configure
my MINCE system, but I had a real rough time trying to define
a new terminal type for the videx 80 column board. Then I decided
to try out each of the standard terminal types offered, and what do
you know, but 2 of them seemed to work perfectly!! The two were:
the SOROC IQ120 and the ADM31 (not the ADM3A). What I'm wondering
is:
   1. Are there any differences between these two (particularly
effeciency) that would recommend one over the other?
   2. Are there any hidden incompatibilities between either of these
terminal types and the videx videoterm?
   3. What was I doing wrong when I tried to specify new terminal
type (I copied the character sequences right out of the videx manual)??
Alternatively, what are the sequences used by Mince when either of 
those terminal types is selected?

The only reason the selection of IQ-120 works on your Videx is because
the emulation table (set up by CONFIGIO.BAS) is already converting from
SOROC to DATAMEDIA (the Videx).  There is actually no similarity between
actual Soroc codes and those of the Videx.

If you were to NUL out the emulation table, you could then install the
exact Videx codes and expect them to work..  There would be no real
advantage to doing this that I know of except possibly a small improvement
in display speed.

There are, I believe, some minor differences in the handling of inverse
between the Soroc and Datamedia, but I can't be specific.

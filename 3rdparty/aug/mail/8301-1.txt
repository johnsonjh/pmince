    Subject: Looking for info on MINCE
    Newsgroups: net.micro,net.emacs

       I will be acquiring a Z80, CP/M system in the near future,
    and am looking for a good (and familiar) screen editor for it.
    Could anyone who has experience with MINCE drop me a line?  In
    particular, I'm interested in:

       - How close to EMACS is the editor interface, barring
         fancy macros, multiple buffers, and more exotic features?

       - What exactly comes with the package?  (Some old ads
         indicate you got source code and a C compiler.)

    Thanks in advance!
                                    Michael Cain

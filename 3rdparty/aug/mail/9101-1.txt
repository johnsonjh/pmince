Way back in the "Golden Age" of personal computing, there was an
operating system called CP/M, which later was renamed CP/M-80 (to
avoid confusion with CP/M-86 and CP/M-68K).  On CP/M-80, were
available three wonderful software packages.  One was a C compiler
called "BDS C" (from BD Software).  One was a text editor called
"MINCE" (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs).  The third was a text formatter
called "Scribble" (a subset of Scribe).  The latter two programs were
from "Mark of the Unicorn".  All three were available seperately.  All
three were available bundled (with much of the source for
Mince/Scribble in BDS-C) into package called "Amethyst".  As the
"Golden Age" was ending, and IBM came out with their "PC",
Mince/Scribble were combined and enhanced into a package called
"FinalWord".  An even more enhanced version called "FinalWord II" came
out a while later.  A year or two after that, the rights to the
program were sold to Borland, who turned it into their product called
"Sprint".  Now, Borland has announced that they have no plans to
continue to upgrade, enhance, or fix Sprint any further.  Some
discussion has been taking place on CompuServe about what should be
done.  It would be truly sad to see such a fine and powerful package
finally die for lack of interest.

As to this newsgroup - there probably is no longer any point.  I doubt
that there are many Amethyst users still actively using CP/M-80.  I
file transferred all of my Mince/Scribble/BDS-C software to MS-DOS
floppies just before de-commissioning my CP/M-80 system, just in case.
In another 5-10 years, I'll probably stop bothering to keep even
those.

Ahem!  According to what I've read on the BORAPP Forum on CompuServe,
Borland has decided that the finest text editor / text formatter
available for personal computers is not part of their "strategic
direction" (or words to that effect), and that there is *NO* ongoing
work being done on Sprint.

My father is writing a book.  I recommended that he buy a cheap PC and
Sprint and let me train his typist to use the basic features.  I would
come in later and fix up the formatting.  (An easy process, since
Sprint is not (yuck!) WYSIWYG.)  Instead, he decided to hire someone
who already owned a PC.  She is using Word Perfect.  I continually
hear horrer stories from him about "things she says cannot be done"
which I know are like "falling off a log" in Sprint.

I won't comment publically on development of Sprint, since I have nothing
to do with that.  However, as far as I know, we *are* still selling and
supporting it.  The main problem with Sprint -- from my point of view --
is that it is exactly what you say it is: an editor and formatter.  I
believe that had Borland decided to sell it as that rather than as a word
processor, it would have had more success.  But that's in the past.

Hmmmmm.....sounds like she doesn't know WordPerfect very well..... of course,
it would be dead simple to write a Sprint macro......

Since I noticed a discussion of Sprint going on here, I thought I would
jump in with a question.

A long time ago I bought a copy of Sprint to play with and, noticing that
it claimed to support a VT100, I attempted to install it to run on my
DEC Rainbow. It seemed to run fine on a PC that was driving a VT100, but
I could never get the thing to come up on the Rainbow; it just printed a
row of H's or something like that and died.

Comments?

  Never noticed anything about vt100 compatibility, and dont have my manuals
here, but...
   My guess is that there would have been a vt100 user interface file for
it.  Sprint is full of undocumented "features" like this, so it could be
some secret command hidden somewhere. 
   You've got me curious, I may need to shuffle through the distribution
disks tonight...
   My other quick guess would be that there is a command somewhere in the
sprint macro language for this purpose.  Don't ask me where to look for it
though.

If you find out, let me know.

There is a VT100 entry in the screen part of the installation; I used that.
That's not the problem. Like I said, it works just fine if I have a PC clone
that I've got a VT100 hung off, or running something like ANSI.SYS or
FANSI-console.

Silly me presumed, however, that if I fixed the screen thing it would be able
to run on a non-clone like the Rainbow. The Rainbow's about as non-clone as
you can get--the floppy controller is managed by a Z80, for instance. The
screen on a Rainbow is a VT100-compatible terminal emulation; since the
Rainbow is a DEC machine, the terminal emulation is very VT100-compatible.
Since the thing works on a VT100 hung off a PC, I assumed it would work on
the Rainbow.

Nope! There is apparently some other PC-specific thing in Sprint. I'm looking
for hints on what it might be.

those.

Sob.  I did not know about the existence of Sprint.  How can one get a
copy.  I used Final Word for a long time, and most of "The Society of

Does Borland still sell Sprint?

Yes.  We even support it.

Ahem!  According to what I've read on the BORAPP Forum on CompuServe,
Borland has decided that the finest text editor / text formatter
available for personal computers is not part of their "strategic
direction" (or words to that effect), and that there is *NO* ongoing
work being done on Sprint.

My father is writing a book.  I recommended that he buy a cheap PC and
Sprint and let me train his typist to use the basic features.  I would
come in later and fix up the formatting.  (An easy process, since
Sprint is not (yuck!) WYSIWYG.)  Instead, he decided to hire someone
who already owned a PC.  She is using Word Perfect.  I continually
hear horrer stories from him about "things she says cannot be done"
which I know are like "falling off a log" in Sprint.

I won't comment publically on development of Sprint, since I have nothing
to do with that.  However, as far as I know, we *are* still selling and
supporting it.  The main problem with Sprint -- from my point of view --
is that it is exactly what you say it is: an editor and formatter.  I
believe that had Borland decided to sell it as that rather than as a word
processor, it would have had more success.  But that's in the past.

Hmmmmm.....sounds like she doesn't know WordPerfect very well..... of course,
it would be dead simple to write a Sprint macro......

Since I noticed a discussion of Sprint going on here, I thought I would
jump in with a question.

A long time ago I bought a copy of Sprint to play with and, noticing that
it claimed to support a VT100, I attempted to install it to run on my
DEC Rainbow. It seemed to run fine on a PC that was driving a VT100, but
I could never get the thing to come up on the Rainbow; it just printed a
row of H's or something like that and died.

Comments?

  Never noticed anything about vt100 compatibility, and dont have my manuals
here, but...
   My guess is that there would have been a vt100 user interface file for
it.  Sprint is full of undocumented "features" like this, so it could be
some secret command hidden somewhere. 
   You've got me curious, I may need to shuffle through the distribution
disks tonight...
   My other quick guess would be that there is a command somewhere in the
sprint macro language for this purpose.  Don't ask me where to look for it
though.

If you find out, let me know.

There is a VT100 entry in the screen part of the installation; I used that.
That's not the problem. Like I said, it works just fine if I have a PC clone
that I've got a VT100 hung off, or running something like ANSI.SYS or
FANSI-console.

Silly me presumed, however, that if I fixed the screen thing it would be able
to run on a non-clone like the Rainbow. The Rainbow's about as non-clone as
you can get--the floppy controller is managed by a Z80, for instance. The
screen on a Rainbow is a VT100-compatible terminal emulation; since the
Rainbow is a DEC machine, the terminal emulation is very VT100-compatible.
Since the thing works on a VT100 hung off a PC, I assumed it would work on
the Rainbow.

Nope! There is apparently some other PC-specific thing in Sprint. I'm looking
for hints on what it might be.

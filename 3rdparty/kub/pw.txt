PERFECT WRITER TIP
by Paul Bobbin, KUB, May/June 1987

(An interesting method of printing PW documents)

Perfect Writer can be used without formatting, and is especially
useful in writing letters, reports and one page documents.  I
have a disk on which I have erased PF.COM leaving lots of room
for other files.  From the KUB library I have added D.COM,
DO.COM, which I renamed GO.COM, PIP.COM, LIST.COM.

To print a file I type GO P (short for print) filename.ext.  This
prints the file EXECUTING any imbedded commands, such as BOLD
FACE, italics, etc.  If I type GO L filename.ext, I will get a
printout which PRINTS the control codes but does NOT execute
them.  Two small submit files do all the work and in addition
they update my file D.DIR each time after printing.

Having an updated C>DIR means you can call up the directory
without leaving PW, then extract a paragraph or a macro file. 
For instance, to print in two columns, the escape codes for my
printer are difficult, so I have a `MAC' file.  This file, which
is inserted after the first column, tells the printer to go to
the end of the page, back-up 66 lines, reset the margins, turn on
the justify and continue printing.

Here are the two P.SUB and L.SUB files:  Replace the commas with
a <cr>.

  PIP LST:=$1,ERA B:D.DIR,B:A:D $$F,A:,D B:

  LIST $1,ERA B:D.DIR,B:A:D $$F,A:,D B:

OK Word Stars, can you do that!
